### Experience
I have been working as a front-end developer since the summer of 2019. Before that, I used to be an entrepreneur operating in the real estate market for about 18 years. I got my university degree in Computer Science with the major in English and Computer Science Teaching. I didnâ€™t have many opportunities to practice coding for a long time, but I had a good base to get some knowledge of modern computer languages. In 2018, I decided to learn Web Development online at Geekbrains. I studied HTML, JavaScript and PHP for about a year. After that, I got a job as a front-end developer with Ajax, a real estate company in Krasnodar. I worked on an in-house product of the company. Vue was my main framework. After six months, I got a job with another company where I have been working until now.  My experience as an entrepreneur made it possible for me to practice my soft skills related to time management, communication, and problem-solving.

Though I have studied various programming languages like PHP, I really like JavaScript because it can help to solve a wide range of tasks, adding an action to a button on a web page, creating an IDE like Visual Studio Code or running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content. It's not at all boring, and I keep doing my best to enhance my knowledge and learn new language features. I would like to become a professional software engineer who could organize and inspire his coworkers to write a good and clean code.
